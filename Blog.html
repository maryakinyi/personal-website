    <h1>BLOG 1(BORN A CRIME)</h1>
    <q>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with traditional wife.For a long time I wondered why he ever married a
    <br>woman like my mom in the first place,as she was opposite of that every way.If he wanted a woman to bow <br> for him,there was plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose.The way my mother
    <br>always explained it,the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient,but he never falls in love with subservient woman.He is<br> attracted to independent woman. "He is like an exotic bird collector, "she said. "He only wants a woman who is
    free
    <br> because his dream is to put her in a cage.
    </q>
    <p>From this extract we can see that the community that Noah is coming from is a male dominated community
        <br> and this is demonstrated by Abel' s side where we are told that men at Abel 's want a woman who is<br> subservient to them which Patricia is not.This brought about commotion between the two parties where
        <br>Abel felt that Patricia disobeyed and disrespected him since she is not always submissive to him and
        <br>lives as an independent woman. Regardless of this fact, Patricia's independence was limited after being to married to Abel. </p>
    <p>On the other hand , Noah's mom is trying make fun practice of the community where Abel comes from.<br>This is evident when they visited Abel's home could take long time kneeling as
        <br>compared to Tzaneen women which was like a mockery to Abel 's culture.This act
        <br>irritated the Tzaneen 's so much and viewed it as a disrespect. </p>
    <p>Noah's community is a true picture of most African communities where men dominate over everything in the<br> family and women have no say even if its their hand work.Like Abel dominates the project that was mostly financed
        <br>by Noah 's mom.Even when the project was going down it was Patricia's responsibility to make sure that the business stands again.</p>

        BLOG 2:HOW HUMOR HAVE BEEN USED IN BORN A CRIME.</h1>
        </b>
        <P>Noah's mother chasing him through the street while yelling after him when she couldn't catch him "stop!thief "and Noah would<br> cry when thugs tried to block him "I am not a thief!I am her son ".This is saved him from wrath from both his<br>            mother and the mob who are after them. </P>
        <p>Noah being thrown out of the moving vehicle by his mother despite being thrown out we find that they they could still run for their lives .
            <br>The act saved them from either being killed or his mother being raped by the driver from Zulu.</p>
        <p>Noah and hi mother argues through jokes about church in most of the sundays where Noah would say that Jesus does not want them
            <br> to go to church.Trevor uses this to emphasize on importance of devotions to human kind.</p>
        <p>Noah's mother tells him "My child look on the bright side" and Noah wonders about the bright side <br> because his mother had shot on the face.Then his mother tells him that he is now the best looking person in the family and they lough.
            <br>This depicts importance of resilience despite circumstances that prevail.</p>
